DESCRIPTION
  Resume watching a deploy operation.

  Use this command to resume watching a deploy operation if the original command
  times out or you specified the --async flag. Deploy operations include
  standard deploys, quick deploys, deploy validations, and deploy cancellations.
  This command doesn't resume the original operation itself, because the
  operation always continues after you've started it, regardless of whether
  you're watching it or not.

  Run this command by either passing it a job ID or specifying the
  --use-most-recent flag to use the job ID of the most recent deploy operation.

ALIASES
  $ sfdx deploy metadata resume

EXAMPLES
  Resume watching a deploy operation using a job ID:

    $ sfdx project deploy resume --job-id 0Af0x000017yLUFCA2

  Resume watching the most recent deploy operation:

    $ sfdx project deploy resume --use-most-recent

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -i, --job-id=<value>  Job ID of the deploy operation you want to resume.

    These commands return a job ID if they time out or you specified the --async
    flag:

    - sfdx project deploy start
    - sfdx project deploy validate
    - sfdx project deploy quick
    - sfdx project deploy cancel

    The job ID is valid for 10 days from when you started the deploy operation.

  -r, --use-most-recent  Use the job ID of the most recent deploy operation.

    For performance reasons, this flag uses job IDs for deploy operations that
    started only in the past 3 days or less. If your most recent operation was
    more than 3 days ago, this flag won't find a job ID.

  -w, --wait=<minutes>

    Number of minutes to wait for the command to complete and display results.

    If the command continues to run after the wait period, the CLI returns
    control of the terminal window to you. To resume watching the deploy
    operation, run this command again. To check the status of the deploy
    operation, run "sfdx project deploy report".

  --coverage-formatters=clover|cobertura|html-spa|html|json|json-summary|lcovonly|none|teamcity|text|text-summary...

    Format of the code coverage results.

    For multiple formatters, repeat the flag for each formatter.
    --coverage-formatters lcov --coverage-formatters clover

                       metadata deploy command.
