USAGE

DESCRIPTION
  Ensures a GitHub repo has correct access to secrets based on its workflows.

  Inspects a repo's yaml files and verifies that secrets required are available
  for the repo (either set at the repo level or shared via organization-level
  secrets).

  This command requires scope:admin permissions to inspect the org secrets and
  admin access to the repo to inspect the repo secrets.

EXAMPLES
  Ensure secrets access for the repo "testPackageRelease", with owner "salesforcecli":

  $ sfdx dev configure secrets --repository salesforcecli/testPackageRelease
