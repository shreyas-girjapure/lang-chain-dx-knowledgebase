USAGE
  $ sfdx project retrieve preview -o <value> [--json] [-c]

FLAGS
  -c, --ignore-conflicts    Don't display conflicts in the preview of the
                            retrieval.
  -o, --target-org=<value>  (required) Login username or alias for the target

DESCRIPTION
  Preview a retrieval to see what will be retrieved from the org, the potential
  conflicts, and the ignored files.

  You must run this command from within a project.

  The command outputs a table that describes what will happen if you run the
  "sfdx project retrieve start" command. The table lists the metadata components
  that will be retrieved and deleted. The table also lists the current conflicts
  between files in your local project and components in the org. Finally, the
  table lists the files that won't be retrieved because they're included in your
  .forceignore file.

  If your org allows source tracking, then this command displays potential
  conflicts between the org and your local project. Some orgs, such as
  production org, never allow source tracking. Source tracking is enabled by
  default on scratch and sandbox orgs; you can disable source tracking when you
  create the orgs by specifying the --no-track-source flag on the "sfdx org
  create scratch|sandbox" commands.

ALIASES
  $ sfdx retrieve metadata preview

EXAMPLES
  Preview the retrieve of all changes from your default org:

    $ sfdx project retrieve preview

  Preview the retrieve when ignoring any conflicts from an org with alias
  "my-scratch":

    $ sfdx project retrieve preview --ignore-conflicts --target-org \
      my-scratch

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -c, --ignore-conflicts

    Don't display conflicts in the preview of the retrieval.

    This flag applies only to orgs that allow source tracking. It has no effect
    on orgs that don't allow it, such as production orgs.

  -o, --target-org=<value>  Login username or alias for the target org.

    Overrides your default org
