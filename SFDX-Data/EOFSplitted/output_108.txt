DESCRIPTION
  Bulk delete records from an org using a CSV file. Uses Bulk API 1.0.

  The CSV file must have only one column ("Id") and then the list of record IDs
  you want to delete, one ID per line.

  When you execute this command, it starts a job and one or more batches,
  displays their IDs, and then immediately returns control of the terminal to
  you by default. If you prefer to wait, set the --wait flag to the number of
  minutes; if it times out, the command outputs the IDs. Use the job and batch
  IDs to check the status of the job with the "sfdx force data bulk status"
  command. A single job can contain many batches, depending on the length of the
  CSV file.

EXAMPLES
  Bulk delete Account records from your default org using the list of IDs in
  the "files/delete.csv" file:

    $ sfdx force data bulk delete --sobject Account --file files/delete.csv

  Bulk delete records from a custom object in an org with alias my-scratch and
  wait 5 minutes for the command to complete:

    $ sfdx force data bulk delete --sobject MyObject__c --file \
      files/delete.csv --wait 5 --target-org my-scratch
