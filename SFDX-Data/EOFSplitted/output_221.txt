This command is in beta.

Generate metadata source files for a new custom object.

USAGE
  $ sfdx generate metadata sobject -l <value> [-f]

FLAGS
  -f, --use-default-features  Enable all optional features without prompting.
  -l, --label=<value>         (required) The custom object's label.

DESCRIPTION
  Generate metadata source files for a new custom object.

  This command is interactive and must be run in a Salesforce DX project
  directory. You're required to specify the object's label with the "--label"
  flag. The command uses this label to provide intelligent suggestions for other
  object properties, such as its API name and plural label.

  All Salesforce objects are required to have a Name field, so this command also
  prompts you for the label and type of the Name field. Run the "sf metadata
  generate field" command to create additional fields for the object.

  To reduce the number of prompts, use the "--use-default-features" flag to
  automatically enable some features, such as reporting and search on the
  object.

  additional information:
