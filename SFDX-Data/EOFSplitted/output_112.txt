DESCRIPTION
  Deletes a single record from a Salesforce or Tooling API object.

  Specify the record you want to delete with either its ID or with a list of
  field-value pairs that identify the record. If your list of fields identifies
  more than one record, the delete fails; the error displays how many records
  were found.

  When specifying field-value pairs, use the format <fieldName>=<value>. Enclose
  all field-value pairs in one set of double quotation marks, delimited by
  spaces. Enclose values that contain spaces in single quotes.

  This command deletes a record from Salesforce objects by default. Use the
  --use-tooling-api flag to delete from a Tooling API object.

ALIASES
  $ sfdx force data record delete

EXAMPLES
  Delete a record from Account with the specified (truncated) ID:

    $ sfdx data delete record --sobject Account --record-id 00180XX

  Delete a record from Account whose name equals "Acme":

    $ sfdx data delete record --sobject Account --where "Name=Acme"

  Delete a record from Account identified with two field values, one that
  contains a space; the command uses the org with alias "my-scratch":

    $ sfdx data delete record --sobject Account --where "Name='Universal \
      Containers' Phone='(123) 456-7890'" --target-org myscratch

  Delete a record from the Tooling API object TraceFlag with the specified
  (truncated) ID:

    $ sfdx data delete record --use-tooling-api --sobject TraceFlag \
      --record-id 7tf8c
