Generate a flag for an existing command.

USAGE
  $ sfdx dev generate flag [-d]

FLAGS
  -d, --dry-run  Print new flag code instead of adding it to the command file.

DESCRIPTION
  Generate a flag for an existing command.

  You must run this command from within a plugin directory, such as the
  directory created with the "sf dev generate plugin" command.

  This command is interactive. It first discovers all the commands currently
  implemented in the plugin, and asks you which you want to create a new flag
  for. It then prompts for other flag properties, such as its long name,
  optional short name, type, whether it's required, and so on. Long flag names
  must be kebab-case and not camelCase. The command doesn't let you use an
  existing long or short flag name. When the command completes, the Typescript
  file for the command is updated with the code for the new flag.

  Use the --dry-run flag to review new code for the command file without
  actually udpating it.

EXAMPLES
  Generate a new flag and update the command file:

    $ sfdx dev generate flag

  Don't actually update the command file, just view the generated code:

    $ sfdx dev generate flag --dry-run
