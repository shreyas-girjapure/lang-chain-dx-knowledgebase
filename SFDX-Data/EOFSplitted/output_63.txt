Convert a script file that contains deprecated sfdx-style commands to use the new sf-style commands instead.

USAGE
  $ sfdx dev convert script -s <value> [--json]

FLAGS
  -s, --script=<value>  (required) Filepath to the script you want to convert.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Convert a script file that contains deprecated sfdx-style commands to use the
  new sf-style commands instead.

  Important: Use this command only to get started on the sfdx->sf script
  migration. We don't guarantee that the new sf-style command replacements work
  correctly or as you expect. You must test, and probably update, the new script
  before putting it into production. We also don't guarantee that the JSON
  results are the same as before.

  This command can convert a large part of your script, but possibly not all.
  There are some sfdx-style commands that don't have an obvious sf-style
  equivalent. In this case, this command doesn't replace the sfdx-style command
  but instead adds a comment to remind you that you must convert it manually.
  See the Salesforce CLI Command Reference for migration information about each
  deprecated sfdx-style command: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-
  us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference.htm.

  This command is interactive; as it scans your script, it prompts you when it
  finds an sfdx-style command or flag and asks if you want to convert it to the
  displayed suggestion. The command doesn't update the script file directly;
  rather, it creates a new file whose name is the original name but with
  "-converted" appended to it. The script replaces all instances of "sfdx" with
  "sf". For each prompt you answer "y" to, the command replaces the sfdx-style
  names with their equivalent sf-style ones. For example, "sfdx
  force:apex:execute --targetusername myscratch" is replaced with "sf apex run
  --target-org myscratch".

EXAMPLES
  Convert the YAML file called "myScript.yml" located in the current
  directory; the new file that contains the replacements is called
  "myScript-converted.yml":

    $ sfdx dev convert script --script ./myScript.yml
