Generate a new sf hook.

USAGE
  $ sfdx dev generate hook --event
    sf:env:list|sf:env:display|sf:deploy|sf:logout [--force]

FLAGS
  --event=<option>  (required) Event to run hook on. Use colons to separate
                    topic and command names of the event.
                    <options: sf:env:list|sf:env:display|sf:deploy|sf:logout>
  --force           Overwrite existing files.

DESCRIPTION
  Generate a new sf hook.

  You must run this command from within a plugin directory, such as the
  directory created with the "sf dev generate plugin" command.

  The command generates a basic Typescript source file in the "src/hooks"
  directory to get you started. The source file's name is based on the event
  you're hooking into, such as envList.ts for the "sf env list" command.

  The command updates the package.json file, so if it detects conflicts with the
  existing file, you're prompted whether you want to overwrite the file. There
  are a number of package.json updates required for a new hook, so we recommend
  you answer "y" so the command takes care of them all. If you answer "n", you
  must update the package.json file manually.

EXAMPLES
  Generate source file for a hook into the "sf env display" command:

    $ sfdx dev generate hook --event sf:env:display
