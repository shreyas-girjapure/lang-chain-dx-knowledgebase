DESCRIPTION
  Delete all org shapes for a target org.

  A source org can have only one active org shape. If you try to create an org
  shape for a source org that already has one, the previous shape is marked
  inactive and replaced by a new active shape. If you donâ€™t want to create
  scratch orgs based on this shape, you can delete the org shape.

ALIASES
  $ sfdx force org shape delete

EXAMPLES
  Delete all org shapes for the source org with alias SourceOrg:

    $ sfdx org delete shape --target-org SourceOrg

  Delete all org shapes without prompting:

    $ sfdx org delete shape --target-org SourceOrg --no-prompt
