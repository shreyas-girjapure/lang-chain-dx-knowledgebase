DESCRIPTION
  Cancel a deploy operation.

  Use this command to cancel a deploy operation that hasn't yet completed in the
  org. Deploy operations include standard deploys, quick deploys, deploy
  validations, and deploy cancellations.

  Run this command by either passing it a job ID or specifying the
  --use-most-recent flag to use the job ID of the most recent deploy operation.

ALIASES
  $ sfdx deploy metadata cancel

EXAMPLES
  Cancel a deploy operation using a job ID:

    $ sfdx project deploy cancel --job-id 0Af0x000017yLUFCA2

  Cancel the most recent deploy operation:

    $ sfdx project deploy cancel --use-most-recent

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -i, --job-id=<value>  Job ID of the deploy operation you want to cancel.

    These commands return a job ID if they time out or you specified the --async
    flag:

    - sfdx project deploy start
    - sfdx project deploy validate
    - sfdx project deploy quick
    - sfdx project deploy cancel

    The job ID is valid for 10 days from when you started the deploy operation.

  -r, --use-most-recent  Use the job ID of the most recent deploy operation.

    For performance reasons, this flag uses job IDs for deploy operations that
    started only in the past 3 days or less. If your most recent deploy
    operations was more than 3 days ago, this flag won't find a job ID.

  -w, --wait=<minutes>

    Number of minutes to wait for the command to complete and display results.

    If the command continues to run after the wait period, the CLI returns
    control of the terminal window to you. To resume watching the cancellation,
    run "sfdx project deploy resume". To check the status of the cancellation,
    run "sfdx project deploy report".

  --async  Run the command asynchronously.

    The command immediately returns the control of the terminal to you. This
    way, you can continue to use the CLI. To resume watching the cancellation,
    run "sfdx project deploy resume". To check the status of the cancellation,
    run "sfdx project deploy report"
