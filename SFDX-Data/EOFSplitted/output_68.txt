Generate a new sf plugin.

USAGE
  $ sfdx dev generate plugin

DESCRIPTION
  Generate a new sf plugin.

  This command is interactive. You're prompted for information to populate your
  new plugin, such as its name, description, author, and percentage of code
  coverage you want. The command clones the 'salesforcecli/plugin-template-sf'
  GitHub repository, installs the plug-in's npm package dependencies using yarn
  install, and updates the package properties.

  When the command completes, your new plugin contains the source, message, and
  test files for a sample "sf hello world" command.
