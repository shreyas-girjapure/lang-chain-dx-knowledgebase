DESCRIPTION
  Publish an Experience Builder site to make it live.

  Each time you publish it, you update the live site with the most recent
  updates. When you publish an Experience Builder site for the first time, you
  make the site's URL live and enable login access for site members.

  Additionally, to send a welcome email to all site members, you must activate
  the site. (Activation is also required to successfully set up SEO for
  Experience Builder sites.) To activate a site, update the status field of the
  Network type in the Metadata API. Alternatively, in Experience Workspaces, go
  to Administration | Settings, and click Activate.

  Subsequently, each time you publish the site, you update the live site with
  all changes made to the site since it was last published.

  An email notification informs you when your changes are live.

ALIASES
  $ sfdx force community publish

EXAMPLES
  Publish the Experience Builder site with name "My Customer Site':

    $ sfdx community publish --name 'My Customer Site'
