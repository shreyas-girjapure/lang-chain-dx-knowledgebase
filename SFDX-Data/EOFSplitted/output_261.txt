Log out of a Salesforce org.

USAGE
  $ sfdx org logout [--json] [-a | -o <value>] [-p]

FLAGS
  -a, --all                 Include all authenticated orgs.
  -o, --target-org=<value>  Username or alias of the target org.
  -p, --no-prompt           Don't prompt for confirmation.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Log out of a Salesforce org.

  If you run this command with no flags, it first displays a list of orgs you've
  created or logged into, with none of the orgs selected. Use the arrow keys to
  scroll through the list and the space bar to select the orgs you want to log
  out of. Press Enter when you're done; the command asks for a final
  confirmation before logging out of the selected orgs.

  The process is similar if you specify --all, except that in the initial list
  of orgs, they're all selected. Use --target-org to logout of a specific org.
  In both these cases by default, you must still confirm that you want to log
  out. Use --no-prompt to never be asked for confirmation when also using --all
  or --target-org.

  Be careful! If you log out of a scratch org without having access to its
  password, you can't access the scratch org again, either through the CLI or
  the Salesforce UI.

ALIASES
  $ sfdx force auth logout
  $ sfdx auth logout

EXAMPLES
  Interactively select the orgs to log out of:

    $ sfdx org logout

  Log out of the org with username me@my.org:

    $ sfdx org logout --target-org me@my.org

  Log out of all orgs after confirmation:

    $ sfdx org logout --all

  Logout of the org with alias my-scratch and don't prompt for confirmation:

    $ sfdx org logout --target-org my-scratch --no-prompt

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -a, --all  Include all authenticated orgs.

    All orgs includes Dev Hubs, sandboxes, DE orgs, and expired, deleted, and
    unknown-status scratch orgs
