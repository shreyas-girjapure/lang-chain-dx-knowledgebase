The force:org:delete command is deprecated. Use org:delete:scratch or org:delete:sandbox.
Delete a scratch or sandbox org.

USAGE
  $ sfdx force org delete -o <value> [--json] [--api-version <value>] [-p]

FLAGS
  -o, --target-org=<value>  (required) Username or alias of the target org.
  -p, --no-prompt           No prompt to confirm deletion.
  --api-version=<value>     Override the api version used for api requests made
                            by this command

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Delete a scratch or sandbox org.

  Salesforce CLI marks the org for deletion in either the Dev Hub org (for
  scratch orgs) or production org (for sandboxes)
  and then deletes all local references to the org from your computer.

  To mark the org for deletion without being prompted to confirm, specify
  --noprompt.

EXAMPLES
  $ sfdx force org delete -u me@my.org

  $ sfdx force org delete -u MyOrgAlias -p
