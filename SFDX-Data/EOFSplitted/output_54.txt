                               org.
  -x, --manifest=<value>       Full file path for manifest (package.xml) of

DESCRIPTION
  Preview a deployment to see what will deploy to the org, the potential
  conflicts, and the ignored files.

  You must run this command from within a project.

  The command outputs a table that describes what will happen if you run the
  "sfdx project deploy start" command. The table lists the metadata components
  that will be deployed and deleted. The table also lists the current conflicts
  between files in your local project and components in the org. Finally, the
  table lists the files that won't be deployed because they're included in your
  .forceignore file.

  If your org allows source tracking, then this command displays potential
  conflicts between the org and your local project. Some orgs, such as
  production org, never allow source tracking. Source tracking is enabled by
  default on scratch and sandbox orgs; you can disable source tracking when you
  create the orgs by specifying the --no-track-source flag on the "sfdx org
  create scratch|sandbox" commands.

  To preview the deployment of multiple metadata components, either set multiple
  --metadata <name> flags or a single --metadata flag with multiple names
  separated by spaces. Enclose names that contain spaces in one set of double
  quotes. The same syntax applies to --manifest and --source-dir.

ALIASES
  $ sfdx deploy metadata preview

EXAMPLES
  NOTE: The commands to preview a deployment and actually deploy it use similar flags. We provide a few preview examples here, but see the help for "sfdx project deploy start" for more examples that you can adapt for previewing.

  Preview the deployment of source files in a directory, such as force-app, to
  your default org:

    $ sfdx project deploy preview  --source-dir force-app

  Preview the deployment of all Apex classes to an org with alias
  "my-scratch":

    $ sfdx project deploy preview --metadata ApexClass --target-org \
      my-scratch

  Preview deployment of a specific Apex class:

    $ sfdx project deploy preview --metadata ApexClass:MyApexClass

  Preview deployment of all components listed in a manifest:

    $ sfdx project deploy preview --manifest path/to/package.xml

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -c, --ignore-conflicts  Don't display conflicts in preview of the deployment.

    This flag applies only to orgs that allow source tracking. It has no effect
    on orgs that don't allow it, such as production orgs.

  -d, --source-dir=<value>...  Path to the local source files to preview.

    The supplied path can be to a single file (in which case the operation is
    applied to only one file) or to a folder (in which case the operation is
    applied to all metadata types in the directory and its subdirectories).

    If you specify this flag, don’t specify --metadata or --manifest.

  -o, --target-org=<value>  Login username or alias for the target org.

    Overrides your default org.

  -x, --manifest=<value>

    Full file path for manifest (package.xml) of components to preview.

    All child components are included. If you specify this flag, don’t specify
    --metadata or --source-dir
