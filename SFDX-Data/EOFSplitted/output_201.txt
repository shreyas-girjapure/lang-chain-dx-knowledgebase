We plan to deprecate this command in the future. Try using the "project deploy cancel" command instead.
Cancel a source deployment.

                            defaults to your most recent CLI deployment if not
                            specified.

  -w, --wait=<value>        [default: 33 minutes] Number of minutes to wait for
                            the command to complete and display results.

DESCRIPTION
  Cancel a source deployment.

  Use this command to cancel a specified asynchronous source deployment. You can
  also specify a wait time (in minutes) to check for updates to the canceled
  deploy status.

  To run the command asynchronously, set --wait to 0, which immediately returns
  the job ID. This way, you can continue to use the CLI. To check the status of
  the job, use "force source deploy report".

EXAMPLES
  Cancel a deployment and wait two minutes:

    $ sfdx force source deploy cancel --wait 2

  If you have multiple deployments in progress and want to cancel a specific
  one, specify the job ID:

    $ sfdx force source deploy cancel --jobid <jobid>

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -w, --wait=<value>

    Number of minutes to wait for the command to complete and display results.

    If the command continues to run after the wait period, the CLI returns
    control of the terminal window to you
