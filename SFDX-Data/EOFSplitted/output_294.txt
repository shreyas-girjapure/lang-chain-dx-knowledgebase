DESCRIPTION
  Links a plugin into the CLI for development.
  Installation of a linked plugin will override a user-installed or core plugin.

  e.g. If you have a user-installed or core plugin that has a 'hello' command,
  installing a linked plugin with a 'hello' command will override the
  user-installed or core plugin implementation. This is useful for development
  work
