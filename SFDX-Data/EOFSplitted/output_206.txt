We plan to deprecate this command in the future. Try using the "project retrieve start" command instead.

DESCRIPTION
  Pull changed source from the org to your project to keep them in sync.

  If the command detects a conflict, it displays the conflicts but does not
  complete the process. After reviewing the conflict, rerun the command with the
  --forceoverwrite parameter.

EXAMPLES
  Pull source from your default org:

    $ sfdx force source pull

  Pull source from the org with alias "myscratch"; ignore any conflicts and
  overwrite the local project files with org changes; wait for only 5 minutes:

    $ sfdx force source pull --target-org myscratch --wait 5 \
      --forceoverwrite

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -w, --wait=<value>

    Number of minutes to wait for the command to complete and display results to
    the terminal window.

    If the command continues to run after the wait period, the CLI returns
    control of the terminal window to you
