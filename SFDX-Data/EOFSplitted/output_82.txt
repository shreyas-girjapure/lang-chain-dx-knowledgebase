    <value>]

  -f, --file=<value>        Path to a local file that contains Apex code.
  -o, --target-org=<value>  (required) Username or alias of the target org.
  --api-version=<value>     Override the api version used for api requests made

DESCRIPTION
  Execute anonymous Apex code entered on the command line or from a local file.

  If you don’t run this command from within a Salesforce DX project, you must
  specify the —-target-org flag.

  To execute your code interactively, run this command with no flags. At the
  prompt, enter all your Apex code; press CTRL-D when you're finished. Your code
  is then executed in a single execute anonymous request.
  For more information, see "Anonymous Blocks" in the Apex Developer Guide.

ALIASES
  $ sfdx force apex execute

EXAMPLES
  Execute the Apex code that's in the ~/test.apex file in the org with the
  specified username:

    $ sfdx apex run --target-org testusername@salesforce.org --file \
      ~/test.apex

  Similar to previous example, but execute the code in your default org:

    $ sfdx apex run --file ~/test.apex

  Run the command with no flags to start interactive mode; the code will
  execute in your default org when you exit. At the prompt, start type Apex
  code and press the Enter key after each line. Press CTRL+D when finished.

    $ sfdx apex run

COMMANDS
  apex run test  Invoke Apex tests in an org
