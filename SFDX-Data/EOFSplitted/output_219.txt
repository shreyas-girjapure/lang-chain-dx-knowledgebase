This command is in beta.

Generate metadata source files for a new custom field on a specified object.

USAGE
  $ sfdx generate metadata field -l <value> [-o <value>]

FLAGS
  -l, --label=<value>   (required) The field's label.
  -o, --object=<value>  The directory that contains the object's source files.

DESCRIPTION
  Generate metadata source files for a new custom field on a specified object.

  This command is interactive and must be run in a Salesforce DX project
  directory. You're required to specify the field's label with the "--label"
  flag. The command uses this label to provide intelligent suggestions for other
  field properties, such as its API name.

  You can generate a custom field on either a standard object, such as Account,
  or a custom object. In both cases, the source files for the object must
  already exist in your local project before you run this command. If you create
  a relationship field, the source files for the parent object must also exist
  in your local directory.  Use the command "sf metadata retrieve -m
  CustomObject:<object>" to retrieve source files for both standard and custom
  objects from your org.  To create a custom object, run the "sf generate
  metadata sobject" command or use the Object Manager UI in your Salesforce org.

ALIASES
  $ sfdx generate metadata field

EXAMPLES
  Create a field with the specified label; the command prompts you for the
  object:

    $ sfdx generate metadata field --label "My Field"

  Specify the local path to the object's folder:

    $ sfdx generate metadata field --label "My Field" --object \
      force-app/main/default/objects/MyObject__c

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -o, --object=<value>  The directory that contains the object's source files.

    The object source files in your local project are grouped in a directoy with
    the same name as the object. Custom object names always end in "__c". An
    example of the object directory for the Account standard object is
    "force-app/main/default/objects/Account" An example custom object directory
    is "force-app/main/default/objects/MyObject__c"

    If you don't specify this flag, the command prompts you to choose from your
    local objects
