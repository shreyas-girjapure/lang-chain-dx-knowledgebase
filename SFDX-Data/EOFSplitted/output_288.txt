DESCRIPTION
  Installs a plugin into the CLI.
  Can be installed from npm or a git url.

  Installation of a user-installed plugin will override a core plugin.

  e.g. If you have a core plugin that has a 'hello' command, installing a
  user-installed plugin with a 'hello' command will override the core plugin
  implementation. This is useful if a user needs to update core plugin
  functionality in the CLI without the need to patch and update the whole CLI
