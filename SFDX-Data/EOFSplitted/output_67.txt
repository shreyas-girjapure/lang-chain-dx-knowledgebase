Generate a new library.

USAGE
  $ sfdx dev generate library

DESCRIPTION
  Generate a new library.

  This command is interactive. You're prompted for information to populate the
  new library, such as the npm scope (which must start with "@"), the name and
  description of the library, and its GitHub organization. The command clones
  the 'forcedotcom/library-template' GitHub repository, installs the library's
  npm package dependencies using yarn install, and updates the package
  properties.

  When the command completes, your new library contains a few sample source and
  test files to get you started.

EXAMPLES
  $ sfdx dev generate library
