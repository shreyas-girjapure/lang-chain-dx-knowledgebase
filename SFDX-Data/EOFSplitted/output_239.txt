Delete a sandbox.

USAGE
  $ sfdx org delete sandbox -o <value> [--json] [-p]

FLAGS
  -o, --target-org=<value>  (required) Sandbox alias or login user.
  -p, --no-prompt           Don't prompt the user to confirm the deletion.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Delete a sandbox.

  Salesforce CLI marks the org for deletion in the production org that contains
  the sandbox licenses and then deletes all local references to the org from
  your computer.
  Specify a sandbox with either the username you used when you logged into it,
  or the alias you gave the sandbox when you created it. Run "sfdx org list" to
  view all your orgs, including sandboxes, and their aliases.

ALIASES
  $ sfdx env delete sandbox

EXAMPLES
  Delete a sandbox with alias my-sandbox:

    $ sfdx org delete sandbox --target-org=my-sandbox

  Specify a username instead of an alias:

    $ sfdx org delete sandbox --target-org=myusername@example.com.qa

  Delete the sandbox without prompting to confirm :

    $ sfdx org delete sandbox --target-org=my-sandbox --no-prompt
