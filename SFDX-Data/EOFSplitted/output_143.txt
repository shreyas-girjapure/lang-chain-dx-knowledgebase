DESCRIPTION
  Create a scratch org configuration (shape) based on the specified source org.

  Scratch org shapes mimic the baseline setup (features, limits, edition, and
  Metadata API settings) of a source org without the extraneous data and
  metadata.

  Run "sfdx org list shape" to view the available org shapes and their IDs.

  To create a scratch org from an org shape, include the "sourceOrg" property in
  the scratch org definition file and set it to the org ID of the source org.
  Then create a scratch org with the "sfdx force:org:create" command.

ALIASES
  $ sfdx force org shape create

EXAMPLES
  Create an org shape for the source org with alias SourceOrg:

    $ sfdx org create shape --target-org SourceOrg
