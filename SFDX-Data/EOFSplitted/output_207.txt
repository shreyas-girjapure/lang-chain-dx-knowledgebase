We plan to deprecate this command in the future. Try using the "project deploy start" command instead.

DESCRIPTION
  Push changed source from your project to an org to keep them in sync.

  If the command detects a conflict, it displays the conflicts but does not
  complete the process. After reviewing the conflict, rerun the command with the
  --forceoverwrite parameter.

EXAMPLES
  Push source to your default org:

    $ sfdx force source push

  Push source to the org with alias "myscratch"; ignore any conflicts and
  overwrite with org with the local project changes; wait for only 5 minutes:

    $ sfdx force source push --target-org myscratch --wait 5 \
      --forceoverwrite

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -w, --wait=<value>

    Number of minutes to wait for the command to complete and display results to
    the terminal window.

    If the command continues to run after the wait period, the CLI returns
    control of the terminal window to you
