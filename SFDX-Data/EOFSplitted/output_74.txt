DESCRIPTION
  Delete a scratch org.

  Salesforce CLI marks the org for deletion in the Dev Hub org and then deletes
  all local references to the org from your computer.
  Specify a scratch org with either the username or the alias you gave the
  scratch org when you created it. Run "sfdx org list" to view all your orgs,
  including scratch orgs, and their aliases.

ALIASES
  $ sfdx env delete scratch

EXAMPLES
  Delete a scratch org with alias my-scratch-org:

    $ sfdx org delete scratch --target-org=my-scratch-org

  Specify a username instead of an alias:

    $ sfdx org delete scratch --target-org=test-123456-abcdefg@example.com

  Delete the scratch org without prompting to confirm :

    $ sfdx org delete scratch --target-org=my-scratch-org --no-prompt
