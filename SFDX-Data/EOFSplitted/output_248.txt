List authorization information about the orgs you created or logged into.

USAGE
  $ sfdx org list auth [--json]

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  List authorization information about the orgs you created or logged into.

  This command uses local authorization information that Salesforce CLI caches
  when you create a scratch org or log into an org. The command doesn't actually
  connect to the orgs to verify that they're still active. As a result, this
  command executes very quickly. If you want to view live information about your
  authorized orgs, such as their connection status, use the "org list" command.

ALIASES
  $ sfdx force auth list
  $ sfdx auth list

EXAMPLES
  List local authorization information about your orgs:

    $ sfdx org list auth
