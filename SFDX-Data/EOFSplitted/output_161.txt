DESCRIPTION
  Install a version of a package in the target org.

  To install a package, specify a specific version of the package using the 04t
  package ID. The package and the version you specified installs in your default
  target org unless you supply the username for a different target org.

  For package upgrades, to specify options for component deprecation or deletion
  of removed components, include an --upgrade-type value. To delete components
  that can be safely deleted and deprecate the others, specify --upgrade-type
  Mixed (the default). To deprecate all removed components, specify
  --upgrade-type DeprecateOnly. To delete all removed components, except for
  custom objects and custom fields, that don't have dependencies, specify
  --upgrade-type Delete. (Note: This option can result in the loss of data that
  is associated with the deleted components.) The default is Mixed.

ALIASES
  $ sfdx force package beta install
  $ sfdx force package install

EXAMPLES
  Install a package version with the specified ID in the org with username
  "me@example.com":

    $ sfdx package install --package 04t... --target-org me@example.com

  Install a package version with the specified alias into your default org:

    $ sfdx package install --package awesome_package_alias

  Install a package version with an alias that includes spaces into your
  default org:

    $ sfdx package install --package "Awesome Package Alias"

  Install an unlocked package version with the specified ID and deprecate all
  removed components:

    $ sfdx package install --package 04t... --upgrade-type DeprecateOnly

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -a, --apex-compile=all|package

    Compile all Apex in the org and package, or only Apex in the package;
    unlocked packages only.

    Applies to unlocked packages only. Specifies whether to compile all Apex in
    the org and package, or only the Apex in the package.

    For package installs into production orgs, or any org that has Apex Compile
    on Deploy enabled, the platform compiles all Apex in the org after the
    package install or upgrade operation completes.

    This approach assures that package installs and upgrades donâ€™t impact the
    performance of an org, and is done even if --apex-compile package is
    specified.

  -r, --no-prompt  Don't prompt for confirmation.

    Allows the following without an explicit confirmation response: 1) Remote
    Site Settings and Content Security Policy websites to send or receive data,
    and 2) --upgrade-type Delete to proceed.

  -t, --upgrade-type=DeprecateOnly|Mixed|Delete

    Upgrade type for the package installation; available only for unlocked
    packages.

    For package upgrades, specifies whether to mark all removed components as
    deprecated (DeprecateOnly), to delete removed components that can be safely
    deleted and deprecate the others (Mixed), or to delete all removed
    components, except for custom objects and custom fields, that don't have
    dependencies (Delete). The default is Mixed. Can specify DeprecateOnly or
    Delete only for unlocked package upgrades.
