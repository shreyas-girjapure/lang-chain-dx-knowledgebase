The top-level deploy command is deprecated. You should use `functions deploy` to deploy functions, and use `project deploy start` to deploy metadata to Salesforce orgs.
Deploy a project interactively to any Salesforce environment.

USAGE
  $ sfdx deploy [--interactive]

FLAGS
  --interactive  Force the CLI to prompt for all deployment inputs.

DESCRIPTION
  Deploy a project interactively to any Salesforce environment.

  This command must be run from within a project.

  The command first analyzes your project, your active or logged-into
  environments, and local defaults to determine what to deploy and where to
  deploy it. The command then prompts you for information about this particular
  deployment and provides intelligent choices based on its analysis.

  For example, if your local project contains a source directory with metadata
  files in source format, the command asks if you want to deploy that Salesforce
  app to an org. The command lists your connected orgs and asks which one you
  want to deploy to. The list of orgs starts with scratch orgs, ordered by
  expiration date with the most recently created one first, and then Dev Hub and
  production orgs ordered by name. If the command finds Apex tests, it asks if
  you want to run them and at which level.

  The command stores your responses in the "deploy-options.json" file in your
  local project directory and uses them as defaults when you rerun the command.
  Specify --interactive to force the command to reprompt.

  Use this command for quick and simple deploys. For more complicated
  deployments, use the environment-specific commands, such as "sfdx project
  deploy start", that provide additional flags.

EXAMPLES
  Deploy a project and use stored values from a previous command run:

    $ sfdx deploy

  Reprompt for all deployment inputs:

    $ sfdx deploy --interactive
