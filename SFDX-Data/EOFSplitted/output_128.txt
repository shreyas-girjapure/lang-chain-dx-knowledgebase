Display record counts for the specified standard or custom objects.

USAGE
  $ sfdx limits recordcounts display -o <value> [--json] [-s <value>] [--api-version
    <value>]

FLAGS
  -o, --target-org=<value>  (required) Username or alias of the target org.
  -s, --sobject=<value>...  [default: ] API name of the standard or custom
                            object for which to display record counts.
  --api-version=<value>     Override the api version used for api requests made
                            by this command

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Display record counts for the specified standard or custom objects.

  Use this command to get an approximate count of the records in standard or
  custom objects in your org. These record counts are the same as the counts
  listed in the Storage Usage page in the Setup UI. The record counts are
  approximate because they're calculated asynchronously and your org's storage
  usage isn't updated immediately. To display all available record counts, run
  the command without the --sobject flag.

ALIASES
  $ sfdx force limits recordcounts display
  $ sfdx org list sobject record-counts

EXAMPLES
  Display all available record counts in your default org:

    $ sfdx limits recordcounts display

  Display record counts for the Account, Contact, Lead, and Opportunity
  objects in your default org:

    $ sfdx limits recordcounts display --sobject Account --sobject Contact \
      --sobject Lead --sobject Opportunity

  Display record counts for the Account and Lead objects for the org with
  alias "my-scratch-org":

    $ sfdx limits recordcounts display --sobject Account --sobject Lead \
      --target-org my-scratch-org
