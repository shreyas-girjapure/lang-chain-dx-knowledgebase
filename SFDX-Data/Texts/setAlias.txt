Set one or more aliases on your local computer.

USAGE
  $ sfdx alias set [--json]

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Set one or more aliases on your local computer.

  Aliases are user-defined short names that make it easier to use the CLI. For
  example, users often set an alias for a scratch org usernames because they're
  long and unintuitive.  Check the --help of a CLI command to determine where
  you can use an alias.

  You can associate an alias with only one value at a time. If you set an alias
  multiple times, the alias points to the most recent value. Aliases are global;
  after you set an alias, you can use it in any Salesforce DX project on your
  computer.

  Use quotes to specify an alias value that contains spaces. You typically use
  an equal sign to set your alias, although you don't need it if you're setting
  a single alias in a command.

ALIASES
  $ sfdx force alias set

EXAMPLES
  Set an alias for a scratch org username:

    $ sfdx alias set my-scratch-org=test-sadbiytjsupn@example.com

  Set multiple aliases with a single command:

    $ sfdx alias set my-scratch-org=test-sadbiytjsupn@example.com \
      my-other-scratch-org=test-ss0xut7txzxf@example.com

  Set an alias that contains spaces:

    $ sfdx alias set my-alias='alias with spaces'

  Set a single alias without using an equal sign:

    $ sfdx alias set my-scratch-org test-ss0xut7txzxf@example.com
